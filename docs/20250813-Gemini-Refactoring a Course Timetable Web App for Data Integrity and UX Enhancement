# End-of-Session Summary

**Date:** August 13, 2025
**Title:** Refactoring a Course Timetable Web App for Data Integrity and UX Enhancement

## Main Theme

The session focused on a comprehensive refactoring of a TalTech course timetable web application. The primary goal was to resolve data inconsistency issues that caused bugs in the user-facing filters (Faculty, Institute, Group). The process evolved from simple front-end bug fixes to a complete overhaul of the data processing pipeline, culminating in a robust, multi-stage Python script that scrapes, cleans, and unifies data before it is ever sent to the browser. Additional user experience features were also implemented.

---

## Process Summary

The development process was iterative, with each step revealing deeper insights into the data architecture:

1.  **Initial Bug:** The session began with the user reporting duplicate entries in the "Faculty" filter and an empty "Group" filter.
2.  **Front-End Fixes:** Initial attempts focused on modifying the JavaScript logic in `main.js` to correctly process and de-duplicate the data being loaded from multiple JSON files.
3.  **Architectural Shift:** It was determined that performing data joins on the client-side was inefficient and error-prone. The strategy shifted to creating a Python "build script" to pre-process and unify all data sources into a single `unified_courses.json` file.
4.  **Pipeline Refinement:** The Python script was refined to generate group and instructor mappings directly from the master timetable file (`all_dailytimetables.json`), aiming to simplify the pipeline to only two source files.
5.  **Root Cause Discovery:** This simplified pipeline failed, leading to the key discovery: `all_dailytimetables.json` is an **incomplete source** for course relationships. Courses without scheduled sessions (e.g., doctoral studies) were being omitted, causing the filter bugs to reappear.
6.  **Final Pipeline Design:** The solution was to create a final, robust Python script that uses a two-step process:
    *   First, run the user's proven, separate script to reliably scrape the difficult Doktoriõpe timetable and save its output.
    *   Second, run a new master script that scrapes the Bak/Mag timetables and then **loads** the pre-scraped Doktoriõpe data. This combined data is then used to generate the final, clean `unified_courses.json` and `sessions.json` files.
7.  **UX Enhancements:** With a stable data pipeline, several user experience improvements were added to `main.js`, including adding URL parameters for filters and allowing the filter pane to be closed by clicking outside of it.
8.  **Final Touches:** A data freshness statement was added to `index.html`, and a final CSS bug related to negative margins that made the text invisible was identified and fixed.

## Errors Encountered & Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Duplicate Faculties & Empty Group Filter** | Flawed JavaScript logic and incomplete data from a Python script that relied solely on the timetable file, which omits courses without scheduled sessions. | The final Python script was reconfigured to load data from the user's separate, working Doktoriõpe scraper. The `main.js` logic was corrected to unconditionally process all groups from the now-complete `unified_courses.json`. |
| **`ElementClickInterceptedException` in Scraper** | The scraping script was trying to click elements on a dynamic web page before they were fully interactive, causing other elements to intercept the click. | The script's scraping logic was reverted to the user's original, more robust "clean slate" method, which reloads the main page before scraping each group to ensure a predictable state. |
| **`ValueError` in Python Script** | The Doktoriõpe scraping function failed completely and not returning the expected number of values, causing the main script to crash. | The pipeline was redesigned to not scrape Doktoriõpe directly, but to load the JSON output from the user's separate, reliable Doktoriõpe scraping script. |
| **Data Freshness Text Invisible on Page** | A `mb-[-1rem]` (negative bottom margin) CSS class on the text's container was causing the header to be pulled up and over the text, hiding it. | The `mb-[-1rem]` class in `index.html` was replaced with `mb-2` to provide a standard, positive margin, making the text visible. |

## Key Code Snippets

### Final `postProcessUnifiedData` Function in `main.js`
This function correctly processes the complete data from `unified_courses.json`, fixing the filter bugs.
```javascript
function postProcessUnifiedData() {
    allSchoolNames.clear();
    schoolToInstitutes.clear();
    facultyToGroupsMap.clear();
    const uniqueGroups = new Set();

    allCourses.forEach(course => {
        // Step 1: Unconditionally collect ALL groups from every course.
        if (course.groups && course.groups.length > 0) {
            course.groups.forEach(group => uniqueGroups.add(group));
        }
        
        // Step 2: Conditionally build maps for courses that have a school/faculty.
        if (course.school_code && course.school_name) {
            allSchoolNames.set(course.school_code, { et: course.school_name, en: course.school_name_en || course.school_name });
            
            if (!schoolToInstitutes.has(course.school_code)) {
                schoolToInstitutes.set(course.school_code, new Set());
            }
            if (course.institute_name) {
                schoolToInstitutes.get(course.school_code).add(course.institute_name);
            }
            
            if (course.groups && course.groups.length > 0) {
                if (!facultyToGroupsMap.has(course.school_code)) {
                    facultyToGroupsMap.set(course.school_code, new Set());
                }
                course.groups.forEach(group => facultyToGroupsMap.get(course.school_code).add(group));
            }
        }
    });
    
    // Finalize the master list of all unique groups.
    allUniqueGroups = [...uniqueGroups].sort();
}

        if (relevantCourse) {
            params.set('institutecode', relevantCourse.institute_code);
        }
    }
    if (activeFilters.group) params.set('group', activeFilters.group);
    
    const newUrl = `${window.location.pathname}?${params.toString()}`;
    history.replaceState({}, '', newUrl);

Command Line Actions

The final, stable workflow consists of two main steps executed in the terminal:

Run the Doktoriõpe Scraper: First, run the separate, working script to generate the complete timetable for doctoral studies.

code
Bash
python 25s_scrape_combine_doktoriope.py

Run the Main Pipeline Script: After the Doktoriõpe data is ready, run the all-in-one script to scrape the remaining data, combine it with the doctoral data, and generate the final unified_courses.json and sessions.json files.

code
Bash

python 25s_final_pipeline.py
