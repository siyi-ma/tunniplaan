# 20250816-Filter-Pane-Dropdown-Border-Color-Debugging

## Main Theme
Refactoring and debugging the filter pane dropdown border color in a timetable/calendar web app. Focus on ensuring consistent and user-preferred styling for dropdowns and search inputs in the filter pane.

## Errors Encountered
- **Dropdown border color not updating as expected:**
  - Initial CSS set border color to magenta (`#e4067e`), but user wanted grey.
  - Changing to custom class (`tt-grey-1`) did not reflect on screen.
  - Suspected browser default styles or overriding selectors.
  - Incorrect CSS variable usage (`border-color: tt-magenta !important;`) instead of hex code.

## Solutions Applied
- Identified that browser default styles for `<select>` and `<input>` override custom border color unless `border-width` and `border-style` are set.
- Recommended updating CSS to use explicit border property:
  ```css
  #filterPanel select,
  #filterPanel input[type="search"] {
    border: 1px solid #9396b0 !important; /* tt-grey-1 */
  }
  ```
- Located filter pane definition in `index.html` within `<aside id="filterPanel">` and confirmed dropdowns use `border-tt-grey-1` class.
- Advised checking for inline styles, Tailwind classes, or JS rendering logic that may override CSS.

## Code Snippets
**CSS Fix:**
```css
#filterPanel select,
#filterPanel input[type="search"] {
  border: 1px solid #9396b0 !important;
}
```
**HTML Reference:**
```html
<aside id="filterPanel" ...>
  <select id="schoolFilter" class="... border-tt-grey-1 ..."></select>
  <input type="search" id="groupFilterInput" class="... border-tt-grey-1 ...">
</aside>
```

## Command Line Actions
None required for this session. All changes were made via direct file edits in VS Code.

## Factual Process Summary
- Session began with a request to standardize dropdown border color in the filter pane.
- Initial CSS set border color to magenta; user requested grey as seen on their screen.
- User manually edited CSS to use `tt-grey-1`, but no change appeared.
- Investigation revealed browser default styles and missing border properties as root cause.
- Provided a robust CSS fix using explicit border property.
- Located filter pane definition in `index.html` and confirmed correct element targeting.
- No sensitive data was exposed or used.
- Problem is resolved with the recommended CSS update; further iteration may be needed if JS or inline styles override CSS.
