# 20250816-Filter-Pane-Dropdown-Border-Color-Debugging

## Main Theme
Refactoring and debugging the filter pane dropdown border color in a timetable/calendar web app. Focus on ensuring consistent and user-preferred styling for dropdowns and search inputs in the filter pane.

## Errors Encountered
- **Dropdown border color not updating as expected:**
  - Initial CSS set border color to magenta (`#e4067e`), but user wanted grey.
  - Changing to custom class (`tt-grey-1`) did not reflect on screen.
  - Suspected browser default styles or overriding selectors.
  - Incorrect CSS variable usage (`border-color: tt-magenta !important;`) instead of hex code.

## Solutions Applied
- Identified that browser default styles for `<select>` and `<input>` override custom border color unless `border-width` and `border-style` are set.
- Recommended updating CSS to use explicit border property:
  ```css
  #filterPanel select,
  #filterPanel input[type="search"] {
    border: 1px solid #9396b0 !important; /* tt-grey-1 */
  }
  ```
- Located filter pane definition in `index.html` within `<aside id="filterPanel">` and confirmed dropdowns use `border-tt-grey-1` class.
- Advised checking for inline styles, Tailwind classes, or JS rendering logic that may override CSS.

Improved course card rendering: Cards are now grouped by session status (online, hybrid, offline), sorted alphabetically by course code within each group, and rendered in the specified order. Category headings before cards were removed for a cleaner UI, relying on the legend for status indication.

function renderCourseCards(courses) {
  // Group and sort
  const statusOrder = ['online', 'hybrid', 'offline'];
  const grouped = { online: [], hybrid: [], offline: [] };

  courses.forEach(course => {
    const status = course.session_status || 'offline';
    if (grouped[status]) grouped[status].push(course);
    else grouped['offline'].push(course); // fallback
  });

  // Sort each group by course code
  statusOrder.forEach(status => {
    grouped[status].sort((a, b) => (a.id || '').localeCompare(b.id || ''));
  });

  // Render
  let html = '';
  statusOrder.forEach(status => {
    if (grouped[status].length > 0) {
      html += `<h2 class="course-category">${status.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + status.slice(1)} Courses</h2>`;
      grouped[status].forEach(course => {
        html += renderCourseCard(course); // Your existing card rendering function
      });
    }
  });

  document.getElementById('courseList').innerHTML = html;
}

## Code Snippets
**CSS Fix:**
```css
#filterPanel select,
#filterPanel input[type="search"] {
  border: 1px solid #9396b0 !important;
}
```
**HTML Reference:**
```html
<aside id="filterPanel" ...>
  <select id="schoolFilter" class="... border-tt-grey-1 ..."></select>
  <input type="search" id="groupFilterInput" class="... border-tt-grey-1 ...">
</aside>
```

## Command Line Actions
None required for this session. All changes were made via direct file edits in VS Code.

## Factual Process Summary
- Session began with a request to standardize dropdown border color in the filter pane.
- Initial CSS set border color to magenta; user requested grey as seen on their screen.
- User manually edited CSS to use `tt-grey-1`, but no change appeared.
- Investigation revealed browser default styles and missing border properties as root cause.
- Provided a robust CSS fix using explicit border property.
- Located filter pane definition in `index.html` and confirmed correct element targeting.
- No sensitive data was exposed or used.
- Problem is resolved with the recommended CSS update; further iteration may be needed if JS or inline styles override CSS.
