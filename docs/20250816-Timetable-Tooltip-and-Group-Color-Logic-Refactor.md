# 20250816-Timetable Tooltip and Group Color Logic Refactor

## Main Theme
Refactor and debug the course timetable calendar tooltip logic and session card border color, focusing on bilingual group labels and correct color assignment for elective/mandatory groups.

## Errors Encountered
- **Tooltip Content Order:** Initial tooltips did not follow the requested order (name, instructors, session type, time, room, comment, mandatoryGroups, electiveGroups).
- **Conditional Time/Room Display:** Time and room were shown for all sessions, not just calendar sessions.
- **Group Label Language:** Mandatory/elective group labels were not bilingual; only English was shown.
- **Elective Group Border Color:** Session cards for elective groups did not display the correct light blue border, remaining magenta due to data structure changes.
- **Data Structure Drift:** The group object sometimes used `status` and sometimes `ainekv` to indicate group type, causing conditional logic failures.
- **Automated Patch Failures:** Some automated code edits failed due to chunk index errors, requiring manual instructions and incremental fixes.

## Solutions Applied
- Refactored `buildSessionTooltipHTML` to accept all required fields and a `showTimeAndRoom` flag, ensuring correct tooltip order and conditional time/room display.
- Updated group label logic to use bilingual labels based on `currentLanguage`.
- Fixed border color assignment by checking both `groupInfo.ainekv` and `groupInfo.status` for 'valikuline' and 'kohustuslik'.
- Provided fallback logic to support both old and new data structures for group type.
- Provided manual code instructions when automated patching failed.

## Key Code Snippets
```javascript
// Tooltip group label bilingual logic
const mandatoryLabel = currentLanguage === 'et' ? 'Kohustuslik rühmadele:' : 'Mandatory for groups:';
const electiveLabel = currentLanguage === 'et' ? 'Valikuline rühmadele:' : 'Elective for groups:';

// Border color assignment supporting both data structures
if (
    groupInfo.ainekv === 'valikuline' || groupInfo.status === 'valikuline'
) borderColor = '#4dbed2';
else if (
    groupInfo.ainekv === 'kohustuslik' || groupInfo.status === 'kohustuslik'
) borderColor = '#e4067e';
```

## Command Line Actions
None required; all changes were made via code edits in `main.js`.

## Factual Process Summary
- The session began with a request to refactor tooltip logic for session cards in the timetable calendar.
- Multiple errors were identified, including incorrect tooltip order, non-bilingual group labels, and border color logic failures due to data structure drift.
- Automated patching was attempted but failed due to chunk index errors; manual instructions were provided and applied.
- The tooltip function was refactored to support conditional time/room display and bilingual group labels.
- Border color logic was updated to support both `status` and `ainekv` properties for group type, ensuring correct color display for elective and mandatory groups.
- The session concluded with all requested features implemented and documented, and the process summarized in this markdown file.
